/*Encapsulation in Java is the practice of bundling data (variables) and methods that operate on that data into a single unitâ€”typically a class. It restricts direct access to some components, using access modifiers like private, and provides controlled access through public getters and setters. This promotes data hiding, enhances security, and improves maintainability by preventing unintended interference and allowing changes without affecting external code. */
